## Technologies Used

*   **Mobile App:** React Native
*   **Cloud Backend & AI:** AWS (Lambda, SageMaker, API Gateway, S3)
*   **AI Model:** TensorFlow
*   **Data Processing & Backend API:** Python

## Getting Started

[Will be updated later with instructions on how to run the project and set up the development environment.]

## Work in Progress

This project is currently under development. 

### Day 1 - Setup Complete ✅
